# University-Code

I have uploaded a selection of code I wrote throughout my undergraduate and masters degree, unfortunatly this is not everything I wrote due to losing access to the internal university intranet after graduating but I believe it is a good selection.

There are README files in each folder explaining more about the code, please read these first.
